I made this script for myself, since I reference other YouTube videos and memes a lot in my own content and needed an easy way to download videos.

### How to use it
1. Right-click on "Raw" and save the file
2. Double-click on the .reg file and confirm adding the keys to the registry
3. Download Windows Terminal
4. Copy the video link, go to the folder where you want to download it
5. Right click on the empty space and choose youtube-dl
6. Voil√†!

This script requires **youtube-dl** and **ffmpeg**.
**To install youtube-dl and ffmpeg:**

Open a PowerShell as Administrator and run:
```
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process
Set-ExecutionPolicy Bypass -Scope Process -Force; [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol = [System.Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol -bor 3072; iex ((New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://chocolatey.org/install.ps1'))
choco install youtube-dl ffmpeg
```
